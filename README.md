# Client-Server restaurant application
This is a java project with sockets and threads for OS classes, where we had to create an application where the client could connect to the server.
The application should work as an restaurant, where the server-side was the kitchen and the client-side the costumers.
The costumers sould be able to book a table and to take an order for food.
The app should be able to show for the kitchen witch table were booked and the total price of the order from each one.
